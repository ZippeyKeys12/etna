# Lu Parser

## Description
This workload is a parser and a pretty printer for Lu. Lu is a language
derived from Lua, and it is used in the course CIS 5520: Advanced Programming
at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Strategies
Three strategies (Correct, Hybrid, and Random) are used to test the
correctness of the parser and pretty printer.

Here are the differences between the three strategies, and what behavior
should be expected:

- **Correct**: The list of generated names are predefined, and most of what
is generated by this generator is size-controlled. It is expected to
find the mutants with fewer generated inputs.
- **Random**: It is a simple type-directed generator. It is expected to
find the mutants with more generated inputs.
- **Hybrid**: A combination of the Correct and Random generators.

All three generators should find the same set of mutants.

## Properties
The property-based tests can be found in `Spec.hs`.
