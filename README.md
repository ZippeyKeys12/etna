Current status: 

The code in `bench-suite` should be mostly readable (though not well-documented).
There is also some light documentation on the Haskell side in `Haskell.md` and `Haskell2.md`. 

The code in `bench-tool` is a bit rougher and has not been refactored yet. 
It is high on our to-do list to clean up the code for data analysis and presentation.
For now, see `experiments/haskell-experiments/One.py` for an example of how to generate results.
